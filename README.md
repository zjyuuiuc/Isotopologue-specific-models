# Isotopologue-specific-models
This is a repository where you will find the isotopologue-specific models used to simulate nitrogen transformation rates during the anoxic, oxic, and hypoxic incubations.

The available files are:

(1) isotopologue-specific model for simulating nitrogen transformations during the anoxic incubation, assuming no oxygen isotope exchange between water and nitrite ('Anoxic_experiment_no_exchange').

(2) isotopologue-specific model for simulating nitrogen transformations during the anoxic incubation, assuming complete oxygen isotope exchange between water and nitrite ('Anoxic_experiment_complete_exchange').

(3) isotopologue-specific model for simulating nitrogen transformations during the oxic and hypoxic incubations ('Oxic_Hypoxic_experiments').
